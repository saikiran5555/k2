    "k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers and regressors, several hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's performance. Here are some common hyperparameters and their effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Hyperparameters:\n",
    "�\n",
    "k: The number of nearest neighbors to consider. Choosing an appropriate value of \n",
    "�\n",
    "k is crucial, as it directly affects the bias-variance trade-off. Smaller values of \n",
    "�\n",
    "k result in more complex decision boundaries with higher variance but lower bias, while larger values of \n",
    "�\n",
    "k lead to smoother decision boundaries with lower variance but potentially higher bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance Metric: The distance measure used to calculate the similarity between data points. Common distance metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean distance: Suitable for continuous data.\n",
    "Manhattan distance: Suitable for high-dimensional data or data with a mix of categorical and continuous features.\n",
    "Minkowski distance: Generalization of both Euclidean and Manhattan distances, where the parameter \n",
    "�\n",
    "p determines the type of distance.\n",
    "Weighting Scheme: Specifies how to weight the contributions of the neighbors in the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform weighting: All neighbors contribute equally to the prediction.\n",
    "Distance weighting: Weight neighbors inversely proportional to their distance to the query point, giving closer neighbors more influence.\n",
    "Algorithm: KNN can use different algorithms to efficiently search for nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brute force: Compute distances to all data points. Suitable for small datasets or low-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "KD tree: Construct a binary tree structure to partition the feature space efficiently. Suitable for moderate-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "Ball tree: Partition the data into nested hyper-spherical shells. Suitable for high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "Tuning Hyperparameters:\n",
    "Grid Search or Random Search: Define a grid or range of values for each hyperparameter and evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation. Choose the combination of hyperparameters that yields the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Use techniques like \n",
    "�\n",
    "k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance across different hyperparameter values and select the optimal combination that generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain Knowledge: Leverage any prior knowledge about the dataset or problem domain to guide the selection of hyperparameters. For example, if the dataset is known to have high-dimensional features, consider using algorithms like KD tree or Ball tree for efficient neighbor search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative Experimentation: Experiment with different combinations of hyperparameters and observe their effects on model performance. Fine-tune hyperparameters based on the observed results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated Hyperparameter Optimization: Utilize automated hyperparameter optimization techniques such as Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms to efficiently search for the optimal hyperparameter values."
